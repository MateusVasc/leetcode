# Reverse Array

## Problem Description

An array is a data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, \(A\), of size \(N\), each memory location has some unique index, \(i\) (where \(0 \leq i < N\)), that can be referenced as \(A[i]\) or \(A_i\).

Your task is to reverse an array of integers.

## Example

**Initial array:** \(A = [1, 2, 3]\)

**Return:** \([3, 2, 1]\)

## Function Description

Complete the function `reverseArray` with the following parameter(s):
- `int A[n]`: the array to reverse

## Returns
- `int[n]`: the reversed array

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, \(N\), the number of integers in \(A\).
The second line contains \(N\) space-separated integers that make up \(A\).

## Constraints
- \(1 \leq N \leq 10^3\)
- \(1 \leq A[i] \leq 10^4\), where \(A[i]\) is the \(i^{th}\) integer in \(A\)
